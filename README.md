# ATM Demo

This app is mocks an Automated Teller Machine using Angular 2 and Angular Material.

# Running the app

1. Ensure that you have Node and npm installed on your machine
2. Navigate to the AngularDemo folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Once the dependencies have bene installed you can fire up an HTTP server in the dist folder (/AngularDemo/dist). To easily run an http server you can install an http server with npm by running `npm install -g http-server`. Then navigate to the dist directory and run `http-server`. The server will be hosted on port 8080 by default
